My though for a project would be to implement a program that would allow students to input their RIN and check whjat major specific classes that they can take. Too many times I have tried to sign up for a class only to find out that I do not have the correct prerequisits for it. This program would let students see with their current transcripts what classes that they can take/ fulfull the requirements for. I would work this project with a common repository probably.
